# git add

When changes have been made inside a git repository that you want to keep, you'll need to use the `git add` command.

Items that have not been "tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified.

Generally, you can get away with the command `git add .` which will add ALL files and directories that were added, changed, or deleted.
